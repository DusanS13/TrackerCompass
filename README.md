TRACKER COMPASS 1.0

Tested for 1.16 only.

The compass works both in the nether and overworld.

Speedrunner has to type /settarget to make the compass point to them.
Hunters type /givecompass to get the compass.

Every time the compass is right-clicked it will point towards the speedrunner.
If the speedrunner is in a different dimension than the hunters, the compass cannot track.
